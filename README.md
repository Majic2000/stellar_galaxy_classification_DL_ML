# Aim
The aim of this peice of experimentation is to create algorithms that can, upon analysing the 17 features pertaining to each astronomical object, classify each of them into a Galaxy, Star, or Quasar. Such a problem shifts away from the traditional binary classification problem I am familiar with in some of the labs inundertaken in this module, and adds an extra layer of complexity.

# Dataset
The Stellar Classification Dataset used here contains 100,000 rows of data pertaining to Galaxies, Stars, and Quasars, all taken from the Sloan Dgital Sky Survey's 2017 data release (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17). Information about each astronomical object includes the 17 featuress, such as the redshift (which can be thought of as the distance away from the Earth )at which each objet was identified, the right ascension and declination angle at which they were identified, the filters (infrared,near infrared, green and red) the survery used to capture each object, and an accompanying class that identifies each object as a Galaxy, Star, or Quasar.
